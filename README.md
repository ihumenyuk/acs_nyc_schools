# Project 1: Extreme Heat in New York City Classrooms

I developed this story as part of my studies at Columbia Journalism School's Lede Data Journalism Program, Summer 2025 [Lede Data Journalism Program](https://ledeprogram.com/).

## Aim of Project

This project started when I found this dataset of heat-related ER visits in New York City: https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-features/heat-syndrome/

I found myself asking, how can I quantitively evaluate New York's preparedness for extreme-heat illnesses? I decided to map the percentage of classrooms in NYC public schools with air conditioning and then evaluate for patterns. I found my dataset in an April 2025 article published in Chalkbeat: https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2025/04/17/nyc-schools-still-lack-ac-for-all-ibo-report/#:~:text=dropped%20to%20roughly%2011%25

## Findings

It's very clear that students in Central Brooklyn and East Queens are the worst of off all of the boroughs, with less than half of students being able to access air conditioned classrooms. I'm not sure why. East Midtown and East Queens have, in many ways, very similar economic profiles--they sit at similar rankings below the poverty line and have a similar average household income between $100,000 and $250,000. One major distinction is that East Queens is majority Black, while Midtown is mostly white. Another distinction? There is a higher number of residents in Midtown making over $250,000. Additional reporting is needed to answer these questions.

## Summary of Data Collection Process

I merged multiples CSV files from NYC Public Schools in order to plot my map. The scatter plot used data from the City of New York that I cleaned very minimally.

## Overview of Data Analysis

I merged three sheets, grouped by percentage and neighbourhood, and then found the mean integers. 

## New Skills and Approaches Used

I learned so much during this project! For one, this was my first major dive in Datawrapepr and how to think in and construct different maps and charts and graphs. For one, I discovered that Datawrapper needs very different data sets depending on what visualization is being constructed. This obviously impacts the kind of code that I write. I was surprised, a little, that the first map I generated--a scatter plot of all ~1,400 schools--did not clearly convey a thesis. I pivoted and realized after plotting that a choropleth map was better suited for this story.

## Ways of Improvement

I downloaded pages and pages of CSV files at my initial data collection stage without carefully recording where I found the files. I regret this completely. Had to spend a long time later tracking down exactly where all the important files came from. I need to be better organized next time.
